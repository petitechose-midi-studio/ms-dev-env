# Extended repository manifest for maintainers.
#
# Use when you want a "full" workspace (dev repos + app manager + distribution + examples):
#
#   uv run ms sync --repos --profile maintainer
#
# Notes:
# - Still git-only (no gh required for clone/update).
# - RepoService will skip dirty repos and repos on a different branch.
